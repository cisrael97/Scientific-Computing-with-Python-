My Python Certification Journey
This repository contains a collection of Python projects and exercises completed while I work towards my Python certification.
It serves as a log of my progress, showcasing my growing understanding of Python programming concepts.

The projects and exercises included here cover various aspects of Python programming, including:

Fundamentals: Data types, operators, control flow, loops, functions.
Data Structures: Lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism.
File Handling: Reading from and writing to files.

Please Note: This repository is a work in progress. The code is provided as-is and may not represent production-ready solutions.
Feel free to explore the code, learn from it, and provide constructive feedback.

I am excited to continue learning and expanding my Python skills!
